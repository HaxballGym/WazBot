## main.py

This is the main file for training. With the reward function, you are able to train a pretty capable bot

## reward_testing.py

This file allows you to test your reward functions: you are able to play and see in the terminal whether the reward function you defined works for you.

## play_model.py

After your training, you are able to run this file to play against your bot! With this, you can find potential weaknesses from your agent to learn from your mistakes and continue improving.

Happy training!
