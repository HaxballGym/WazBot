# WazBot

This repository is made to provide you with a solid start in HaxballGym.

## Installation

Before installing dependencies with pip, you must first use the appropriate version of pytorch for your system.

The list of wheels is available [here](https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch/)

### pip

`pip install -r requirement.txt`

### Poetry

There is a bug with the version 0.21.0 of gym that makes the installation on Poetry unsmooth. With additional commands, it is possible to still complete the installation.

```bash
poetry install # install everything, except gym who should make an error
poetry run pip install gym==0.21.0
poetry install
```
